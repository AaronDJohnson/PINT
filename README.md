PINT
====

## PINT is not TEMPO3

PINT is a project to develop a new pulsar timing solution based on
python and modern libraries.  It is in the very early stages of
development, but it can already produce residuals from most "normal"
timing models that agree with Tempo and Tempo2 to within ~10
nanoseconds.

The primary reasons we are developing PINT are:
  - To have a robust system to check high-precision timing results that is completely independent of TEMPO and TEMPO2
  - To make a system that is easy to extend and modify due to a good design and the use of a modern programming language, techniques, and libraries
  
For detailed information on installing and developing PINT, see the
[Wiki](https://github.com/nanograv/PINT/wiki) and the documentation in the
doc subdirectory in the distribution.  Also, follow along with the examples
in the examples subdirectory.
